### Do following configuration
When you run this command, the server will show the following prompts. Please follow the steps as shown below to complete the setup correctly.
* Enter current password for root: (Enter your SSH root user password)
* Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]: Y
* Change the root password? [Y/n]: Y
* It will ask you to set new MySQL root password at this step. This can be different from the 
  SSH root user password.
* Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
* Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: N
* This is set as N because we might want to access the database from a remote server for 
  using business analytics software like Metabase / PowerBI / Tableau, etc.
* Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]: Y
* Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]: Y

### Edit mysql default Config file

1. Fix Missing Packages
a. Install libjpeg62-turbo Alternative
The libjpeg62-turbo package might have been replaced or is unavailable for your current Ubuntu version. Try installing the libjpeg8 or libjpeg-turbo8 package, which should be compatible:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
```
b. Install libssl1.1 Alternative
If libssl1.1 is missing, itâ€™s possible that your version of Ubuntu no longer supports it. You can install libssl1.0.0 instead (though this might depend on your specific system):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0
```
Alternatively, you can try installing libssl-dev which should include SSL libraries for development:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
2. Update Your Package Index
Sometimes, package index issues can cause these errors. Update your package lists to ensure your repositories are up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
3. Install the Packages Again
After fixing these issues, you can reattempt installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
  wget \
  build-essential \
  libssl-dev \
  libfontconfig1 \
  libjpeg8-dev \
  libx11-dev \
  libxrender-dev \
  libxext-dev \
  qtbase5-dev \
  qtchooser \
  qt5-qmake \
  qtbase5-dev-tools \
  libpng-dev
```
### Then Download the packagge
Step 1:
```bash
wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-2/wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb
```
Step 2:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb
```
Check installation. 
```bash
wkhtmltopdf --version
```
The output should be something like this wkhtmltopdf 0.12.x.x (with patched qt)

### Install frappe bench
```bash
sudo -H pip3 install frappe-bench --break-system-packages
```
### Install Ansible
```bash
sudo -H pip3 install ansible --break-system-packages
```
### Initialize Frappe Bench
```bash
bench init {bench-name} --frappe-branch version-15
```
### Switch directories into the Frappe Bench directory
```bash
cd {bench-name}
```
### Change user directory permissions
This will give the bench user execution permission to the home directory.
```bash
chmod -R o+rx /home/[user profile]
```
### Start The Bench
```bash
bench start
```
### Create a New Site
```bash
bench new-site [site-name]
```
Enter the MySQL root password which we created while installing mariaDb
Next It will ask to Set Administrator password for the site we created, You can set a password to login to the site and Reenter the password again, 
### This step is Optional
```bash  
bench --site [site-name] add-to-hosts
```
## Install ERPNext and other Apps in Frappe Bench
### Download all the apps we want to install
```bash
bench get-app erpnext --branch version-15
```
### If any other apps we can install like this 
```bash
bench get-app hrms
```
### Install the required app in the site
```bash
bench --site [site-name] install-app erpnext
```
```bash
bench --site [site-name] install-app hrms
```
To enable developer mode do it immediately after installing app to sites before configuration in the UI
```bash
bench set-config -g developer_mode 1
```
alternativelyy we can do for particulaar site only by this cmd, 
[ bench --site your-site-name set-config developer_mode 1 ]

### If bench is running stop it and again start
```bash
bench start
```
Open url http://[site-name]:8000 to login
